# Password-Generator
The Random Password Generator project is part of the Frontend Developer Career Path by Scrimba. It's a SOLO Project where I need to follow a design on Figma and
built it from scratch. The challenge was to generate two random paswwords when the user clicks on the button, each password must be have 15 characters.

I use Figma, VS code and of course my bestfriend Google when needed.
